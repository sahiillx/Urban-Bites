# Urban Bites
Urban Bites, a full stack food delivery web application designed to help users order food from local restaurants. The platform features an Admin Panel, menu browsing, order placement, and real-time order tracking. Utilizing MongoDB for scalable database management and integrating Stripe for secure transactions, I ensured an efficient and seamless user experience from ordering to delivery.
